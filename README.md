# Tabber
A Chrome extension that prevents a buildup of a million tabs by bringing them back to you later - when you need them.
Instead of leaving tabs open in your window and letting them slow down your computer as their number grows, or bookmarking the pages and forgetting about them, set them through Tabber to force open in your browser later, when they will be more convenient.
